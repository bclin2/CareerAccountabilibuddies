# Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0

# Example: If the input is:
#     1 0 1 1 0
#     0 1 1 1 0
#     1 1 1 1 1
#     1 0 1 1 1
#     1 1 1 1 1
# then the output would be:
#     0 0 0 0 0
#     0 0 0 0 0
#     0 0 1 1 0
#     0 0 0 0 0
#     0 0 1 1 0
